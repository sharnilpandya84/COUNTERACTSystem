Abstract: Human movement is a significant factor in extensive spatial-transmission models of contagious viruses. The proposed COUNTERACT system recognizes infectious sites by retrieving location data from a mobile phone device linked with a particular infected subject. The proposed approach is computing an incubation phase for the subject's infection, backpropagation through the subjectsâ€™ location data to investigate a location where the subject has been during the incubation period. Classifying to each such site as a contagious site, informing exposed suspects who have been to the contagious location, and seeking near real-time or real-time feedback from suspects to affirm, discard, or improve the recognition of the infectious site. This technique is based on the contraption to gather confirmed infected subject and possibly carrier suspect area location, correlating location for the incubation days. Security and privacy are a specific thing in the present research, and the system is used only through authentication and authorization. The proposed approach is for healthcare officials primarily. It is different from other existing systems where all the subjects have to install the application. The cell phone associated with the global positioning system (GPS) location data is collected from the COVID-19 subjects.
